System UX is an operating system developed for personal and internal use, it was originally designed with a focus on embedded systems and servers, Transforming into a multifaceted platform that serves a multitude of computing needs.

Engineered to deliver a consistent and reliable operating system, System UX is designed to stay current with updates, providing a unified platform. This initiative aligns with Mier Engineering's commitment to open source and contributing to the broader technology community.

The philosophy of System UX centers around a compact set of packages that meet universal requirements. This design allows for easy customization, enabling users to layer additional packages on top of the common base, tailoring the system to specific workloads. This flexibility is facilitated by a streamlined build system.

Whether deployed as a container, a hypervisor, or a virtual machine host, System UX represents a fusion of simplicity and adaptability, designed to operate across a variety of devices regardless of architecture and kernel version.
